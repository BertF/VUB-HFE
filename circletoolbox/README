This is a collection of files that will plot the standard amplifier
design circles on a Smith chart.  Please email me with any bugs,
complaints, comments, compliments (hopefully lots of those!) or
suggestions.

The files are:
- ga_circles: Draw constant available power gain circles on a Smith Chart.
- gp_circles: Draw constant operating power gain circles on a Smith Chart.
- maximum_gain: Calculate the maximum gain for a specified device.
- noise_circles: Draw constant noise figure circles on a Smith Chart. 
- readme: This file.
- rollett_stability: Evaluate the Rollett stability criteria.
- smith_circles: Draw circles on a Smith Chart.
- smith: Draw a Smith chart.
- stability_circles: Draw stability circles on a Smith Chart.

The equations and examples are from the excellent book "Microwave
Transistor Amplifiers, Analysis and Design," second edition by
Guillermo Gonzalez (ISBN 0-13-254335-4).
